# 👋 Hi, I'm **Deborah Mercy Aunga**

**Mathematics • Data Science • Machine Learning**

I am a graduate student at the **African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)**, where I study the mathematical foundations of data science and artificial intelligence. My work sits at the intersection of **probability**, **statistical learning theory**, and **representation learning**, with applications in humanitarian and public-interest data.

I enjoy building clean, interpretable systems from statistical models to large-scale data pipelines and exploring the theory that makes them reliable.
